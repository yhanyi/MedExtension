# Med-Ext

A simple Chrome extension built as a prototype/draft for NUS YLLSoM's Health Hack 2024.

The team consists of:

- Hong Ruey
- Jia Yang
- Qing Rong
- Marcus
- Han Yi

To run this prototype, download this zip file.

Then go to chrome://extensions/.

Select "Load unpacked" and select the med-extension folder.

To activate it, press Ctrl + B or Cmd + B. A pop up should appear.

To search a term, highlight it, and select Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X. A tooltip popup should generate within a few seconds depending on request and internet speed to summarize the medical term. The tooltip stays on the screen for 5 seconds.
